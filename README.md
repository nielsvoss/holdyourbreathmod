# Hold Your Breath - A Minecraft Mod

A Minecraft mod for Fabric 1.20.1 which makes players hold their breath in real life when they go underwater.

## Breath Holding

Players press the `R` key (configurable) to tell the server that they are holding their breath.
When a player stops holding their breath, they will release the `R` key.
This requires the honor system to work.

A player will need to press `R` before entering the water to avoid drowning.
As long as the `R` key is held down, players will not lose air.
As soon as the `R` key is released, players will start losing air at a drastically increased rate
(this rate is configurable).
This way, players can stay underwater as long as they can hold their breath, but once they breathe they will start
losing air.

If the `R` key is released underwater, pressing it again will not stop air loss.
You can think of this as exhaling underwater causing your mouth to fill up with water, preventing breathing.
